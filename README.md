My Algorithms and Data Structures Course Overview

In my Algorithms and Data Structures course, I am delving deep into both the theoretical and practical aspects of Java. This course is structured to enhance my skills and understanding of various advanced topics. By the end of this course, I aim to have gained proficiency in the following areas:

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:

I am focusing on thoroughly understanding and applying OOP concepts, which is essential for writing efficient and modular Java code.
Generic Classes and Interfaces:

I am learning to use generic classes and interfaces, enhancing the flexibility and reusability of my code.
Recursive Methods:

I am developing skills in writing recursive methods, a crucial technique for solving complex problems more simply.
Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions:

I am exploring the use of functional interfaces and lambda expressions to write more concise and functional-style Java code.
Writing Maintainable Code:

A significant part of my learning is focused on writing maintainable code, aiming to minimize cyclomatic and cognitive complexity.
Algorithm Efficiency:

I am learning to determine and explain the efficiency of algorithms, an essential skill for optimizing code performance.
Java Collection Framework:

I am mastering the use of classes and interfaces in the Java Collection Framework for efficient data manipulation.
Data Streams and Operator Chaining:

I am solving computational problems by chaining operators on data streams, a powerful feature in Java for data processing.
Sorting and Searching Algorithms:

I am gaining an understanding of different sorting and searching algorithms and learning to implement them in Java.
Algorithm and Data Structure Selection:

I am learning to choose and apply the most appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve a given computational problem effectively.
This course is enhancing my skills in advanced Java programming, preparing me to tackle complex coding challenges and develop high-quality software solutions.

Specific Algorithms Covered:

Sorting: MergeSort, QuickSort, and other simple sorting techniques.
Searching: Binary Search and other efficient searching methods.
Data Structures: HashSets, HashMaps, Trees (Binary Search Trees, TreeSet, TreeMap), Graphs.
Advanced Concepts: Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search, Minimum Spanning Tree, and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm.

Course Schedule and Activities:
The course is structured across two terms, with each week focusing on specific topics, ranging from OOP fundamentals to advanced data structures like Graphs and Trees. Each week includes practical sessions and assignments, reinforcing my learning and application of these concepts.
