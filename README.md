### My Algorithms and Data Structures Course Overview

In my Algorithms and Data Structures course, I am delving deep into both the theoretical and practical aspects of Java. I am collaborating on this project with one other classmate By the end of this course, I aim to have gained proficiency in the following areas:

**1. Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Principles:** <br>
I am focusing on thoroughly understanding and applying OOP concepts, which is essential for writing efficient and modular Java code.

**2. Generic Classes and Interfaces:** <br>
I am learning to use generic classes and interfaces, enhancing the flexibility and reusability of my code.

**3. Recursive Methods:** <br>
I am developing skills in writing recursive methods, a crucial technique for solving complex problems more simply.

**4. Functional Interfaces and Lambda Expressions:** <br>
I am exploring the use of functional interfaces and lambda expressions to write more concise and functional-style Java code.

**5. Writing Maintainable Code:** <br>
A significant part of my learning is focused on writing maintainable code, aiming to minimize cyclomatic and cognitive complexity.

**6. Algorithm Efficiency:** <br>
I am learning to determine and explain the efficiency of algorithms, an essential skill for optimizing code performance.

**7. Java Collection Framework:** <br>
I am mastering the use of classes and interfaces in the Java Collection Framework for efficient data manipulation.

**8. Data Streams and Operator Chaining:** <br>
I am solving computational problems by chaining operators on data streams, a powerful feature in Java for data processing.

**9. Sorting and Searching Algorithms:** <br>
I am gaining an understanding of different sorting and searching algorithms and learning to implement them in Java.

**10. Algorithm and Data Structure Selection:** <br>
I am learning to choose and apply the most appropriate algorithms and data structures to solve a given computational problem effectively.

This course is enhancing my skills in advanced Java programming, preparing me to tackle complex coding challenges and develop high-quality software solutions.
